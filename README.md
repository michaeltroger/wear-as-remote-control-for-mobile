A simple Android Studio 3 starter project for using an Android Wear 2 Smartwatch as remote control for an Android Smartphone.

The smartphone module (mobile folder) is a standalone example app allowing to create and cancel a notification by clicking on _start_/_stop_.

The smartwatch module (wear folder) needs a smartphone with the _mobile_ module installed. It can send start and stop commands which result in opening/closing of a notification on the smartphone just like it can be done directly on the phone. 

This application is intented to be used with Android Nougat (Android 7) and Oreo (Android 8) devices.
